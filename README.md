Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake arcade game using Python's Turtle graphics library. You can control the snake using arrow keys and eat the green food while avoiding collisions with the screen boundaries and yourself.

How to Use
Installation: There are no additional libraries required beyond Python's standard libraries. Simply download the Python script, and you're ready to play.

Running the Game:

bash
```
python snake.py
```

Game Controls:

Use the Arrow Keys to control the snake's direction:
Up: Move the snake up
Down: Move the snake down
Left: Move the snake left
Right: Move the snake right
Objective:

Eat the green food that appears on the screen to make the snake longer.
Avoid running into the screen boundaries or colliding with the snake's own body, as it will result in a game over.
Scoring:

The game keeps track of your score, which is the length of the snake. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
Customization:

You can customize the game by adjusting the constants in the script:
SNAKE_SPEED: Controls the speed of the snake. Increase it for a faster game or decrease it for a slower game.
SNAKE_MOVE_DISTANCE: Controls how far the snake moves in each step.
Additional Features
This Snake game includes the following features:

Snake speed adjustment.
Screen boundary detection (the snake cannot go off-screen).
Random placement of food after it is eaten.
